The Meal Deal is an application that is intended to have the functionality to suggest recipes based on an user input of the available ingredients he/she has. 

However for this project the app only have some of its pages and basic functionality.

Main Page for a logged in user - have four buttons - to search by ingredient, to browse all recipes, to browse favourites and to add new recipe.

Browsing page - scroll to see more recipes, and swipe to see the next category. Currently there are three categories - vegeterian, vegan and meat, but this can be improved.

To add new recipe you have a form and a button. A camera service was intended to take a picture of the meal.

The recipe page can be accessed when adding new recipe or choosing a recipe from the browsing pages. Two buttons show the ingredients and method of cooking. A button can add the recipe to the user's favourites.
